The deliverables will depend on what your method is, which depend on your goals. It must be approvd and the final submitted will have to meet what is approved.  Some guidance:
- any code or text should be managed with git (can be GitHub or elsewhere)
- if you write any code it should have documentation
- if you do experiments the results should be summrized
- if you are researching something, a report should be 2-4 pages in the 2 column [ACM format.](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template)

This guidance is generative, not limiting, it is to give ideas, but not restrict what you *can* do.
