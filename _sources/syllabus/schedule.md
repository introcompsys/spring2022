# Schedule



## Overview

The following is a rough outline of topics in an order, these things will be filled into the concrete schedule above  as we go.  These are, in most cases bigger quetions than we can tackle in one class, but will give the general idea of how the class will go.  

This plan accounts for 1 less week than we actually have.  We will either go over somewhere or we'll use the last week for sharing projects, reflection, or an additional topic that comes up during the semester.

### How does this class work?

_one week_

 We'll spend the first two classes introducing some basics of GitHub and setting expectations for how the course will work. This will include how you are expected to learn in this class which requires a bit about how knowledge production in computer science works and a bit of the history.  

### How do all of these topics relate?

_approximatley two weeks_

We'll spend a few classes doing an overview where we go through each topic in a litte more depth than an introduction, but not as deep as the rest of the semester. In this section, we will focus on how the different things we will see later all relate to one another more than a deep understanding of each one.  At the end of this unit, we'll work on your grading contracts.

We'll also learn more key points in history of computing to help tie concepts together in a narrative.

```{tip}
We will integrate history throughout the whole course.  Connecting ideas to
one another, and especially in a sort of narrative form can help improve retention of ideas. My goal is for you to learn.  

We'll also come back to differnt topics over and over again with a slightly different framing each time.  This will both connect ideas, give you chance to practice recalling (more recall practice improves long term rentention of things you learn), and give you a chance to learn things in different ways.
```

Topics:
- bash
- man pages (built in help)
- terminal text editor
- git
- survey of hardware
- compilation
- information vs data

### What tools do Computer Scientists use?

_approximately four weeks_

Next we'll focus in on tools we use as computer scientists to do our work.  We will use this as a way to motivate how different aspects of a computer work in greater detail.   

Topics:
- linux
- git
- i/o
- ssh and ssh keys
- number systems
- file systems


### What Happens When I run code?

_approximately five weeks_

Finally, we'll go in really deep on the compilation and running of code. In this part, we will work from the compilation through to assembly down to hardware and then into machine representation of data.   

Topics:
- software system and Abstraction
- programming languages
- cache and memory
- compiliation
- linking
- basic hardware components


## Finalized Order

Content from above will be expanded and slotted into specific classes as we go. This will always be a place you can get reminders of what you need to do next and/or what you missed if you miss a class as an overivew.  More Details will be in other parts of the site, linked to here.
