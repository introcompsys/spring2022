    "- Sorry, I'm adapting based on how far we get, so I don't have time to get iterative feedback on them.\n",

    "- also *always* feel free to ask more questions (slack or github issue to class repo)\n",
    "- you *always* can revise your work, so it's also okay, espeically for more practice to put in the place of a response a question or try re-interpreting the instructions to check if they're correct.\n",
