    "temp += x * x;\n",

    "\n",
    "In this one, we first copy the `accum` value to a temporary variable, then square the value and add that to `temp`, and then finally add that value back to `accum`. This should be equivalent to the program above, result wise.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though this is not how we wrote our program, this is actually what it has to do, as we spin out each process.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This table traces through what occurs in two threads.\n",
    "```{list-table}\n",
    "\n",
    "* - // Thread 1\n",
    "  - // Thread 2\n",
    "  - Status\n",
    "* - `int temp1 = accum;`\n",
    "  - `int temp2 = accum;`  \n",
    "  - now `temp1 = temp2 = 0`\n",
    "* -   \n",
    "  - `temp2 += 2 * 2;\n",
    "  - now temp2 = 4\n",
    "* - temp1 += 1 * 1;\n",
    "  -\n",
    "  - // temp1 = 1\n",
    "* - accum = temp1;\n",
    "  -\n",
    "  - // accum = 1\n",
    "* - accum = temp2;\n",
    "  -\n",
    "  - // accum = 4\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So, what happens is each thread looks at the current value of `accum` and stores it to a thread-specific temporary variable. Each thread has its own memory, but they do all share the global variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then thread 2 completes its calculation and updates `temp2` and thread 1 updates `temp1`.  So far everything is okay, but next thread 1 writes to `accum` and sets it to 1, and finally thread to writes to `accum` and makes it 4.  The two values from the threads did not get added together, because thread 2 started before thread 1 finished.  \n",
    "\n",
    "So, we end up losing some of the values.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Locking\n",
    "\n",
    "We can instead change our `square` function as follows:\n",

    "int accum = 0;\n",

    "\n",
    "    return NULL; /* nothing to return, prevent warning */\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "and save this to a new file `sq_sum_threaded_m.c`\n",
    "\n",
    "This version uses something from the pthread library, to create a lock.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now when it executes each thread will do the calculation part on it's own time, possibly simultaneously. Then the lock part means that they will each take turns to add their value to the global variable `accum`.\n",
