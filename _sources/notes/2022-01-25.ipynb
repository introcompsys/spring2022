    "### Why does github seem so simple on a surface level? but to actually use it requires much deeper knowledge...\n",
    "```{toggle}\n",
    "GitHub provides a user friendly wrapper around git, which is an open source version control tool that is designed to be very powerful for and primarily used by, experienced programmers with a good knowledge of files systems.  Git is in fact a special file system. GitHub makes the most common actions easier so that more people can do them, but the underlying tool can do so many things, so it can be complicated.\n",
