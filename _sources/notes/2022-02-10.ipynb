    "In order to watch what happens in hardware when a program runs, which is our goal today, we will execute a compiled program. It is written in assembly code.  Typically, we do not write assembly, but instead it is produced by the compiler.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Technically assembly instructions and the values we operate on are represented in binary on hardware, but these more readable level instructions, though basic, are a useful abstraction.  These instructions are also hardware nonspecific.  \n",

Then, if the value is greater than 0, it jumps to line to line 10 in the ROM (of the instructions). Line 10, sets A to 0 and 11 sets D to the value from RAM 0. If, instead, the value is less than 0, A is set 1, then and D is set to that value. Then the program points A to 2 and writes the value from D there.\n",

The Emulator that we used today showed the numbers in RAM and the instructions both in higher level representations than binary.  The advantage to assembly is that it is hardware independent and human readable. It is low level and limited to what the hardware *can* do, but it is a version of that that can be run on different hardware.\n",
