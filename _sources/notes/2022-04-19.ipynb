    "\n",
    "## Control Unit\n",
    "\n",
    "The control unit converts binary instructions to signals and timing to direct the other components.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###  What signals?\n",
    "\n",
    "We will go to the ALU again since the control unit serves it to figure out what it needs.  \n",
    "Remember in the ALU, has input signals that determine which calculation it will execute based on the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Timing signals?\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, the ALU itself tells us why we need this, we saw that different calculations the ALU does take different amount of times to propagate through the circuit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even adding numbers of different numbers that require different number of carries can take different amount of times.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the control unit waits an amount of time, that's longer than the slowest calculation before sending the next instruction.  It also has to wait that long before reading the output of the ALU and sending that result to memory as needed.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a clock?\n",
    "\n",
    "In a computer the clock refers to a clock signal, historically this was called a logic beat. This is represented by a sinusoidal (sine wave) or square (on, off, on, off) signal that operates with a constant frequency.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This has changed a lot over time.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The first mechanical analog computer, the Z1 operated at 1 Hz, or one cycle per second; its most direct successor moved up to 5-10Hz; later there were computers at 100kHz or 100,000Hz, but where one instruction took 20 cycles, so it had an effective rate at 5kHz.\n",
