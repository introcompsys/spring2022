What you don't see might be a little at the lower-level still have a really good but it's lower than that to the zeros and ones that are computers going to run out eventually\n",

    "number yeah so can you change the type of a variable on the fly or do you have to Define it like you to declare what type of variable is going to be so that it can allocate the memory in the right format for that variable and then it's stuck is that type you can't change it until you unless you re initiating are you can't it's not going to be there what else Christian\n",

I like python you can do however you want like it has a lot of functional features it has object-oriented it can find a support doing a lot of the different things in Python is added more functional feature support right there making it more supportive of those actions because they're they're powerful and they're really good for the type of thing to do would like to use Python for what else\n",

    "\n",
    "yeah if you're trying to decide what things you want to run outside of time that's important also knowing kind of how different programming languages compared we saw we saw a list of Unforgiven images Nancy hadn't heard of the four of us out there and if you don't know it in great detail helps you kind of get the landscape of what's out there and how different things are changing and how they interact with another also this sets the stage for the fact that we're not talking about things that are just like cuz I feel like it\n",

    " so when\n",
    "\n",
    " but for example\n",
    "\n",
    " if we talked about a linkage being compiled versus interpreted so a compiled language you write your code you hand it over to compiler and then it gets a machine code I'm about 100 over and over again and interpreted language you write your coat and head to The Interpreter The Interpreter runs and gives you the results back you can run one line at a time you can kind of you but each time you want to run it it's doing any work that's compilation like sort of on the flight as you run it right\n",
    "\n",
    " when would you want one or the other\n",
    "\n",
    "okay so\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " okay so what's on tap at typing with python although it is and then there's static typing which see Elsa is but separate from that she has compiled do it like you get a bill to do that and then python is interpreted so you give him the code of The Interpreter and it runs right one at a time either of those could actually handle a large amount of data or variable size data right cuz you can\n",
    "\n",
    " always\n",
    "\n",
    " like Rita file and get the information then allocate besides that's not going to change that but would be different\n",

    " yeah\n",

    " okay so that would be a case for if you need to make kind of that type of nothing but a compiled language can do that but interpreted\n",

    " I didn't cannot that's good example okay what else would you want one with the other compiled verse Jeopardy Sabrina\n",
    "\n",
    " so if you mean something resource-intensive you want to be compiled so if you're reading something that's going to run like on a small device like a Fitbit or a smartwatch write those don't have a lot of memory didn't have a lot of things he's going to find out where do I have a person I know who works at\n",
    "\n",
    " did he propose in libraries part of NASA her job for awhile was too during the 17-minute window that happens twice a day send code to the Mars rover they can't send pythons are there right they can't let you know the river is is very far away that was 70 minute window to transmit things over a slow satellite link they have like KB a day they can send\n",

    " great it's been gone for a long time so Hardware that we have now is very different than what was available and able to end amount of time before it actually left is what it was designed\n",

    " okay\n",

    " I thought everything was old has a very resources and environment they still need to be able to do real things right it's not a toy problem is not a we're just playing with an Arduino because we feel like it it's a real thing right it's a real real where they had actual Hardware constraints they had to have very a pin code to decide how to collect the data and then how to get it back they know that 17 minute window to happen twice a day they can send its also receive other data back about her experiments in that time but if you really want to send and want to get data back\n",
