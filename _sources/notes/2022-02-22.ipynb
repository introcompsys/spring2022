    "## Git Plumbing Q&A\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Plumbing commands work with the .git directory as a file system directly.\n",
    "Porcelain commands provide higher level interactions with git as a version\n",
    "control system.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What *is* a hash?\n",
    "\n",
    "- a hash is a fixed size value that can be used to represent data of arbitrary sizes\n",
    "- the *output* of a hashing function\n",
    "- often fixed to a hash table\n",
    "\n",
    "A hasing function could be really simple, to read off a hash table, or it can\n",
    "be more complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{list-table}\n",
    "\n",
    "* - Hash\n",
    "  - content\n",
    "* - 0\n",
    "  - Success\n",
    "* - 1\n",
    "  - Failure\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to represent the status of a program running it has two possible\n",
    "outcomes: success or failure. We can use the following hash table and a function\n",
    "that takes in the content and returns the corresponding hash. Then we could pass\n",
    "around the 0 and 1 as a single bit of information that corresponds to the outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lookup table hash works here.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In a more complex scenario, imagine trying to hash all of the new terms you learn\n",
    "in class. A table would be hard for this, because until you have seen them all, you\n",
    "do not know how many there will be.  A more effective way to hash this, is to\n",
    "derive a *hashing function* that is a general strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## When does hashing occur in git?\n",
    "\n",
    "In git we hash both the content directly to store it in the database (.git) directory\n",
    "and the commit information.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall, when we were working in our toy repo we created an empty repository and\n",
    "then added content directly, we all got the same hash, but when we used git\n",
    "commit our commits had different hashes because we have different names and\n",
    "made the commits at different seconds. We also saw that *two* entries were\n",
    "created in the `.git` directory for the commit.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In git, 40 characters that uniquely represent either the content or a commit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mostly, a shorter version of the commit is sufficient to be unique, so we can use those to refer to commits by just a few characters:\n",
    "- minimum 4\n",
    "- must be unique\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "`````{note}\n",
    "You can view commits shorter with options to `git log`\n",

    "\n",
    "## What hashing function does git use?\n",
    "\n",
    "Git uses [SHA-1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3174). See a [generator](https://passwordsgenerator.net/sha1-hash-generator/)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a Secure Hashing Algorithm that is derived from cryptography.  Because\n",
    "it is secure, no set of mathematical options can directly decrypt an SHA-1  hash.\n",
    "It is designed so that any possible content that we put in it returns a unique\n",
    "key. It uses a combination of bit level operations on the content to produce the\n",
    "unique values.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The SHA-1 Algorithm hashes content into a fixed length of 160 bits. This means\n",
    "it can produce $2^160$ different hashes. Which makes the probability of a collision very low.\n",
    "\n",
    "````{margin}\n",
    "```{epigraph}\n",
    "The number of randomly hashed objects needed to ensure a 50% probability of a single collision is about $2^{80}$ (the formula for determining collision probability is p = (n(n-1)/2) * (1/2^160)). $2^{80}$ is 1.2 x 1024 or 1 million billion billion. That’s 1,200 times the number of grains of sand on the earth.\n",

    "GIT strongly relies on SHA-1 for the identification and integrity checking of all file objects and commits. It is essentially possible to create two GIT repositories with the same head commit hash and different contents, say a benign source code and a backdoored one.
