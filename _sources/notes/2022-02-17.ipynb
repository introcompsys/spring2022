    "\n",
    "we noted above that the `git cat-file` only works to git objects. Lets see what objects there are. Today we will see three types today:\n",
    "\n",
    "- blob objects: the content of your files (data)\n",
    "- tree objects: stores file names and groups files together (organization)\n",
    "- Commit Objects: stores information about the sha values of the snapshots\n",
    "\n",
    "First, lets examine the `objects` directory.  This time, instead of using `ls` we'll use the `bash` command `find`. This pattern matches and looks for files or directories and lists the results\n",
    "```\n",
    "find .git/objects/\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    ".git/objects//info\n",
    "```\n",

    "Let's look at another option of this command, the `-type` option filters the results and only returns the ones of the desired type.  We'll look at only files using `f`\n",

    "### Hashing\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "- the `-w` option then tells git to alsow write that object to the database\n",
    "- the `--stdin` option tells `git hash-object` to get the content to be processed from stdin instead of a file\n",
    "- the `|` is called a pipe (what we saw before  was a redirect) it pipes a *process* output into the next command\n",
    "- echo would write to stdout, with the pipe it passes that to stdin for the `git hash-object` to use\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "````{margin}\n",

    "the key is *unique* in that there is a one to one mapping from any particular content to a single key. However, as we saw in class, if we all do the same content, we all get the key same key back\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "git cat-file -p c182a93374d6b18a87e1f1e8a9a18812639c58c8\n",
