You can work in browser, with the GitHub desktop client, using the GitHub CLI, or your favorite IDE's tools. I recommend giving the terminal a serious try because it will have all of the features of git and other tools may not, but your preference is fine.  It could actually be really good for your general understanding to practice with git at least two ways.\n",
