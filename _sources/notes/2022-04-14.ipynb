    "### Do we eventually switch our computers to use more than 64 bits?\n",
    "```{toggle}\n",
    "We really get just about all of the precision we need out of 64 bits and creating registers, ALUs, buses, etc with more than that is more expensive and slower, so mostly there seems to be no need, for general purpose computing.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Switching from 32 to 64 was important not only for precise calculations because we can use memory tricks to circumvent that anyway, but for the ALU to participate in addressing memory.  With 32 bit registers we can only express 2^32 addresses for the RAM, so we can only access 4Gibibytes or 3.8GB RAM (we'll cover this translations later), with 64 bit registers we can address 2^64= 2^32*2^32 so we squared the amount of memory we can address this is 16 Exibbytes or a little bit fewer Exabytes, which is far more than we need for regular computing, while more than 4GB of RAM is quite desirable for everyday use.\n",
