# Glossary

```{tip}
We will build a glossary as the semester goes on. When you encounter a term you do not
know, create an issue to ask for help, or contribute a PR after you find the
answer.

```{glossary}
Bash
  a command line tool that is used to manipulate files and directories



add (new files in a repository)
  the step that stages/prepares files to be committed to a repository from a local branch

git
  a version control tool; it's a fully open source and always free tool, that can be hosted by anyone or used without a host, locally only.

GitHub
  a hosting service for git repositories
  
Git Plumbing commands
  low level git commands that allow the user to access the inner workings of git.
  
Git Workflow
  a recipe or recommendation for how to use Git to accomplish work in a consistent and productive manner

git init name_of_repo
  used to create a git repo in a directory (which can then be uploaded to github or another online directory
  
push (changes to a repository)
  to put whatever you were working on from your local machine onto a remote copy of the repository in a version control system.

pull (changes from a repository)
  download changes from a remote repository and update the local repository with these changes.
  
repository
  a project folder with tracking information in it in the form of a .git file
  

shell
  a command line interface; allows for access to an operating system
  
terminal
  a program that makes shell visible for us and allows for interactions with it
  
ROM (Read-Only Memory)
  Memory that only gets read by the CPU
  
directory 
  a collection of files typically created for organizational purposes

.gitignore
  a file in a git repo that will not add the files that are included in this .gitignore file. Used to prevent files from being unnecessarily committed.
  
templating
  templating is the idea of changing the input or output of a system. For instance, the Jupyter book, instead of outputting the markdown files as markdown files, displays them as HTML pages (with the contents of the markdown file).
  
ssh keygen
  allows computers to safely connect to networks (such as when we used an ssh key to clone our github repos)
  
hashing
  putting an input through a function and getting a different output for every input (the output is called a hash; used in hash tables and when git hashes commits).
  
hash function
  the actual function that does the hashing of the input (a key, an object, etc.)
  
SHA 1
  the hashing function that git uses to hash its functions (found to have very serious collisions (two different inputs have same hashes), so a lot of software is switching to SHA 256)
  
git objects
  something (a file, directory) that is used in git; has a hash associated with it
  
tree objects
  type of git object in git that helps store multiple files with their hashes (similar to directories in a file system)
  
HEAD
  the branch that is currently being checked out (think of the current branch)
  
merge
  putting two branches together so that you can access files in another branch that are not available in yours
  
Compiled Code
  code that is put through a compiler to turn it into lower level assemlby language before it is executed. must be compiled and re-executed everytime you make a change.
  
interpreted code
  code that is directly executed from a high level language. more expensive and takes up more time.
  
integreated development environment
  also known as an IDE, puts together all of the tools a developer would need to produce code (source code editor, debugger, ability to run code) into one application so that everything can be done in one place. can also have extra features such as showing your file tree and connecting to git and/or github.
