# What do we do next?  


## KWL Maintainance



- Jupyter book
- building and publishing it
- taking ownership

### Making sure it is a jupyterbook

Check that you have:
- `_config.yml` best practice is to copy the [defaults](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/customize/config.html#configuration-defaults) then change the "Book settings" and "# Launch button settings" settings as needed.
- `_toc.yml` follow the [instructions and example](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/structure/toc.html#structure-of-a-book) inthe docs.
- make sure that all of your markdown files are in the `_toc.yml`

### Rendering and publishing it with GitHub

Github Actions allow you to run scripts, both specialized and anythign that you can run in bash on GitHub servers and use those results online.  

What we are goign to do is add a file in `.github/workflows/publish.yml`
To do run jupyterbook on GIthub's server and  then put the contents of the build directory on the gh-pages branch.


```yaml
name: deploy-book

on:
  push:
    branches:
    - main


jobs:
  deploy-book:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2

    # Install dependencies
    - name: Set up Python 3.8
      uses: actions/setup-python@v1
      with:
        python-version: 3.8

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        pip install -r requirements.txt

    # Build book
    - name: Build the book
      run: |
        jupyter-book build . --builder pdfhtml
        mv _build/pdf/book.pdf _build/html/kwlbook.pdf
        jupyter-book build .

    # Push the book's html to github-pages
    - name: GitHub Pages action
      uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3.6.1
      with:
        github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        publish_dir: ./_build/html
```

And then a `requirements.txt` file to the top level directory so that it knows what to install (see above we told it to install from requiremetns.txt)

```
jupyter-book
matplotlib
numpy
pyppeteer
pandas
lxml
sphinx_fontawesome
sphinx_panels
```


```{note}
Later, I'll enable you to to
[ turn on pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site) if you would like
```

### Create an issue for its future

Use one of the following as the **title** of the issue.

```
I want to take ownership of my KWL repo and make it public
```

```
I want to take ownership of my KWL repo for my own reference
```

```
I want my kwl repo archived
```

## Review

What happens in linking?

- [ ] code from includes is copied into the file
- [ ] binaries for compiled libraries is combined with the compiled program code
- [ ] code is translated from assembly to machine code
- [ ] code is translated from a high level language to assembly

What are three factors that you could use to choose the right langague for a project?

_assuming you know or have time and motivation to learn many languages_


What is the relationship between a half adder and a full adder?

- [ ] a half adder adds half of the bits in the register and the full adds all
- [ ] a half adder adds two one bit numbers into a two bit number; a full adder adds two one bit numbers and a carry bit into a one bit output and a carry bit
- [ ] a half adder adds two one bit numbers into 1 bit; a full adder adds two one bit nubmers into two bits

## Final Comments

Future sections will be separate sites, all will be listed [on this main site](https://introcompsys.github.io/)




## Feedback


```{important}
If 70% of the class completes the [IDEA survey](https://uri.campuslabs.com/eval-home/direct/6028943) you will **all** get 1(large)-3(small) free mistakes. What this will mean is that,  instead of having you having to find the answer and revise, I will give you the answer as a suggestion and you only have to commit my suggestion to get full credit on it.
