# Review and Abstraction

## Can I reset a Git repository?


<!-- this could use some screen shots for the github step for where to find the commit hash -->
1. Find the hash number for the first commit of your in-class repo.
1. On your terminal, navigate to that repo.
1. Check out that commit `git checkout <paste hash here>`
1. Look back at what happened, using `ls`
1. Make a new branch called 'reset' and push that branch to GitHub.
1. Switch back to the current version of the repo
1. In browser, compare the two branches, visually.

## Moving Files Requires Care

<!-- needs explanation here -->

A question from last week was what happens if we move a file to an address where there already is one?

```
touch fa
echo "file one" > fa
cat fa
```


```
echo "file two" > fb
cat fb
```


```
mv fa fb
cat fb
```

## Standard In, Out, and Error

We have been using bash to move files around and explore the system so far.  In doing so we have also seen `cat` that we saw would display the contents of a file.

What it actually does is a little bit different. Let's try `cat` without putting a file name after it.
```
cat
```

It waits for us to type, if we type and then press enter, what we typed is displayed and it keeps waiting.

Use control/command + d to exit.

`cat` actually looks at standard input, a special file in our computer that gets the input from the keyboard if we don't tell it otherwise.

```
cat fa
```

is a shortcut basically for


```
cat < fa
```
 which says explicitly, get ready to the contents of standard in to standard out and then put the contents of `fa` and put it on standard in. The arrow is called a redirect.


We used `echo` to write to a file above in the little experiment.
```
echo "some text" > a_file
cat a_file
```
and we get output as before

```
some text
```

That line has two new parts both `echo` and the `<` syntax.
Let's try `echo` by itself.

```
echo "hello world"
```
and we see
```
hello world
```
Echo puts content on standard out, which is a special file that is by default linked to the display of the terminal.  It could have been set elsewhere, and that's what the redirect does.

```
echo "some text" > a_file
cat a_file
```

This sends that text to standard out and redirects standard out to the file `a_file`

```
some text
```

if we use two arrows it will append instead of overwriting.
```
echo "some more text" >> a_file
cat a_file
```

```
some text
some more text
```

```
man echo
```

<!-- this was an experiment to answer a question about how to prepend  need to be explained
echo "new prepend" > b_file
echo a_file >> b_file
cat b_file
new prepend
a_file
man echo
man echo
a_file >> b_file
-bash: a_file: command not found -->


|Name |	File descriptor	| Description|	Abbreviation|
|----|---|----|---|
Standard input |	0	|The default data stream for input, for example in a command pipeline. In the terminal, this defaults to keyboard input from the user.|	stdin |
| Standard output |	1| 	The default data stream for output, for example when a command prints text. In the terminal, this defaults to the user's screen.	| stdout |
| Standard error |	2| 	The default data stream for output that relates to an error occurring. In the terminal, this defaults to the user's screen.	| stderr |


```{important}
GitBash [does not support man](https://github.com/swcarpentry/shell-novice/issues/249)
the reasons athe developer [does not want to](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/696) are also visible. You can use the help option `-help` try the help command.  
The help is slightly different from the man pages overall.

Alternatively, you can modify your environment further.
Enabling the Windows subsystem for Linux is one option. So is booting into Linux
[for example ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows#1-overview)
that is installed on a flash drive. This uses the flas drive as the hard drive
for the operating system. This option creates 2 whole "computers" at the
software level, that use the same hardware.
```

```{sidebar}
To contribute to the course site, use the suggest edit button (or go to the repo).

![screenshot of the site glossary with the "suggest edit" option under the GitHub menu at the top right selected](../img/suggest_edit.png)

You don't have edit permission, so it will have you create a [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/about-forks)
Make your edits and commit them to a new branch with a good name and commit message
as usual. Then [open a PR from your fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)
```


## More Practice


```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: ["remove-input"]
display(Markdown('../_practice/2022-02-08.md'))
```



```{tip}
pay attention to how many steps you do to know what value of N to use. You should be able to do all of number 1 in your terminal.
```
````{margin}
```{hint}
redirects (`>`) can be used with other commands, not only echo
```
```{note}
If you get stuck on any of these create an issue and tag @sp22instructors
```

## Questions After class



### What happens if I don't meet the requirements for the grade I contract for?
```{toggle}
You will be able to revise the contract if you choose to earn a different grade.
The revision will also have to get approved, but it is an option. If you do not
fulfill your contract in the form it is stated at the end of the semester, you
will get an incomplete and then we will make a plan to change that to a letter.
```


### When can we expect approved pull requests?
```{toggle}
Feedback hours mostly, which are 5-6pm on Tuesday and 4-5pm on Thursday
```

### Can you echo multiple files at the same time?
```{toggle}
Echo sends only to stdout, we can redirect stdout to a different file, but echo specifically goes to the one place.  The question then becomes can we redirect std out to two places at once, which we cannot do with redirects alone either.  However, we can send output multiple places using a few more commands.  We'll come back to this one next week. Also try the last exercise under more practice.
```

### does this character "<" do something different than the redirect character ">"?
```{toggle}
They are both [redirections](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Redirections.html) `<` is less common.
```


### What's under the hood with `>`?
```{toggle}
The official documentation for [redirections](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Redirections.html) describes some. We'll come back to it after we talk
through the overview of hardware a bit more in the next class.
```


### What level of understanding of the abstraction stack is typical for a programmer?
```{toggle}
This is going to depend on their training.  A person who programs after a short
coding bootcamp or a scientist who codes in order to do their scientific research
may only understnd the application and algorithm layers and be perfectly content
and able to fulfill their goals.  With a Computer Science degree we hope that by
the end you have down to Assembly very strong and the basic ideas down to gates/
registers.  Someone with a Computer Engineering degree will have more understanding
at the lower levels but maybe less in programming languages and algorithms than a
CS degree. Plus anyone can go learn more and forget things they once knew.  Also how much you actively use this knowledge is going to vary.  Someone who writes firmware is going to be focused on a very different point in that stack that someone who develops new machine learning applications for example.
```


## Why you would want to override the name/path of a file?
```{toggle}
You probably would not want to do this very often, but for example, I do this
when I download a newer version of a file and my browser names the new version
something like `file_name (1).ext` I actually wanted to overwrite but it assumes
that I do not, so I use `mv file_name\ (1).ext file_name.ext` to overwrite the
new, updated content into the better file name (without the space and (1))
```

### How does Authentication on GitHub work?
```{toggle}
[GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/about-authentication-to-github) provides a whole page on that with advice and links.
We will also come back to this in order to talk about ssh keys and ssh generally
next week.
