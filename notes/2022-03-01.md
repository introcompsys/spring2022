# How do we build Documenation?


## Review from getting unstuck with git

### Add a results folder and prevent its content from being committed.

Recall, this is our GitHub inclass repo:
```
cd github-in-class-brownsarahm
ls
```

```
CONTRIBUTING.md	README.md	config.txt	docs		setup.py
LICENSE.md	about.md	config.yml	mymodule	tests
```

We saw last week to use the `.gitignore` file to ignore files that match a pattern.



```
cat .gitignore
```
we used a very simple pattern

```
config.*
```
to ignore any config file in this repository.

If we push


```
git push
```

````{margin}
```{note}
Recall here that it is compressing before pushing
```
````


```
Enumerating objects: 44, done.
Counting objects: 100% (42/42), done.
Delta compression using up to 8 threads
Compressing objects: 100% (32/32), done.
Writing objects: 100% (38/38), 2.96 KiB | 1.48 MiB/s, done.
Total 38 (delta 22), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0

To https://github.com/introcompsys/github-in-class-brownsarahm.git
   cea6a93..62b943f  main -> main
```
and view online, we can see that the two config files we have locally are not pushed, becuase they were not added to the .git

```{important}
This is another example of how `git push` does not push the files in the directory, but instead the `.git` directory (compressed) and then
GitHub (and other git hosts) use git operations to show us the contents
of the files based on the repository database.
```

Now, back to our task we first create the directory and then append a new line to it.
```
mkdir results
echo "results/" >> .gitignore
```

Note that the two `>` is needed, not one so tht we append instead of erase.  

```{admonition} Try it yourself
What could you do if you had used only one and overwritten the .gitignore file instead of appending to it?
```

How can we tell that worked? As usual, `git status` is a good place to start.

```
git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   .gitignore

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

When we do git status, we see that we changed the `.gitignore` file but this does not show us that what we put in there actually matches the directory we want to ignore *yet*.

```{important}
git does not track empty directories.
```

````{margin}
```{tip}
If we want to track an "empty" directory a common practice is to add an hidden, often empty file (`.gitkeep` is also hidden) so that it is not really empty anymore, but is empty-looking when we use, eg `ls`
```
````

If we create another empty directory we can see that this is also not showing as an untracked file.
```
mkdir res2

```

```
git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   .gitignore

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

```

We can add an empty file to test that our ignore actually worked.
```
touch results/test1
```

```
git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   .gitignore

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

```
and compare to what hapens if we add an empty file to the directory that does not match our pattern.

```
touch res2/test1

```

```
git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   .gitignore

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	res2/

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

```


```{note}
a directory where all files are untracked  stays as just the directory no matter how many files it is, until you add at least one.
```

```
touch res2/test2

```

```
git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   .gitignore

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	res2/

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

```

```{note}
merge conflict file explanation to be added later
```

## What does it mean to build documentation?
```{note}
For now, see the prismia transcript for an outline here
```

### What is a build?


### Why is documentation so important?


[documentation types table](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10606-018-9333-1/tables/1)

[ethnography of docuemtnation data science](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10606-018-9333-1)

## Building Documentation with Jupyter book

There are many [Documenation Tools](https://docathon.github.io/docathon/pages/resources.html#documentation-tools) because we (programmers) don't like


[linux kernel uses sphinx](https://lwn.net/Articles/705224/)

[why](https://lwn.net/Articles/692704/) and [how it works](https://lwn.net/Articles/692705/)


[Jupyterbook](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html) wraps sphinx and uses markdown instead of restructured text

### Creating a Jupyterbook from the template
We'll naviate out of the github in class repo
```
cd ..
```

and use jupyterbook to create a new book from the template
```
jupyter-book create tiny-book
```

We see this

```

===============================================================================

Your book template can be found at

    tiny-book/

===============================================================================
```
and that it created a new directory
```
ls
```

```
github-in-class-brownsarahm	test				tiny-book
nand2tetris			test2

```
If we navigate to that directory we can create a new repo here as well
```
cd tiny-book/
git init .
```

```
hint: Using 'master' as the name for the initial branch. This default branch name
hint: is subject to change. To configure the initial branch name to use in all
hint: of your new repositories, which will suppress this warning, call:
hint:
hint: 	git config --global init.defaultBranch <name>
hint:
hint: Names commonly chosen instead of 'master' are 'main', 'trunk' and
hint: 'development'. The just-created branch can be renamed via this command:
hint:
hint: 	git branch -m <name>
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/brownsarahm/Documents/sysinclass/tiny-book/.git/

```
and again we'll change our default branch to main
```
git branch -m main

```

```
git status
On branch main

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

```
and we will commit the template.

### Strucutre of a Jupyter book
```
ls
_config.yml		intro.md		markdown.md		references.bib
_toc.yml		logo.png		notebooks.ipynb		requirements.txt

```

A jupyter book has two required files (`_config.yml` and `_toc.yml`)

- [config defaults](https://jupyterbook.org/customize/config.html#configuration-defaults)
- [toc file formatting rules](https://jupyterbook.org/structure/toc.html#structure-of-a-book)

the extention (`.yml`) is [yaml](https://yaml.org/), which stands for "YAML Ain't Markup Language". It consists of key, value pairs and is deigned to be a human-friendly way to encode data for use in any programming language.

```bash
cat _config.yml
```

The configuration file, tells it basic iformation about the book, it provides all of the settings that jupyterbook and sphinx need to render the content as whatever output format we want.
```yaml
# Book settings
# Learn more at https://jupyterbook.org/customize/config.html

title: My sample book
author: The Jupyter Book Community
logo: logo.png

# Force re-execution of notebooks on each build.
# See https://jupyterbook.org/content/execute.html
execute:
  execute_notebooks: force

# Define the name of the latex output file for PDF builds
latex:
  latex_documents:
    targetname: book.tex

# Add a bibtex file so that we can create citations
bibtex_bibfiles:
  - references.bib

# Information about where the book exists on the web
repository:
  url: https://github.com/executablebooks/jupyter-book  # Online location of your book
  path_to_book: docs  # Optional path to your book, relative to the repository root
  branch: master  # Which branch of the repository should be used when creating links (optional)

# Add GitHub buttons to your book
# See https://jupyterbook.org/customize/config.html#add-a-link-to-your-repository
html:
  use_issues_button: true
  use_repository_button: true

```

The table of contents file describe how to put the other files in order.

```bash
cat _toc.yml
```

```yaml
# Table of contents
# Learn more at https://jupyterbook.org/customize/toc.html

format: jb-book
root: intro
chapters:
- file: markdown
- file: notebooks

```

```{admonition} Try it yourself
Which files created by the template are not included in the rendered output? How could you tell?
```

The other files are optional, but common. [Requirements.txt](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#requirements-files) is the format for pip to install python depndencies. There are different standards in other languages for how

```
cat requirements.txt
jupyter-book
matplotlib
numpy

```

the .bib file allows you to put structured data in [bibtex](http://www.bibtex.org/) format and then jupyterbook can write a bibliography for you.  

### How do I get output?

```
jupyter-book build .

[etoc] missing index.html written as redirect to 'intro.html'

===============================================================================

Finished generating HTML for book.
Your book's HTML pages are here:
    _build/html/
You can look at your book by opening this file in a browser:
    _build/html/index.html
Or paste this line directly into your browser bar:
    file:///Users/brownsarahm/Documents/sysinclass/tiny-book/_build/html/index.html            

===============================================================================
```


Then we can see in browser what the output looks like.

we can also see that a _build directory was created and examine that

```
cd _build/
ls
```

it has some cache (jupyter_execute) and our output (html).  [Building](https://jupyterbook.org/basics/build.html) to
html is the default, but there are many [types of buils output](https://jupyterbook.org/basics/build.html#types-of-build-outputs)

```
html		jupyter_execute
```
We can see in the html folder
```
cd html/
ls
```
that there are `html` files for each input file, plus some extra (genindex) and ther is javascript for searching the site
```
_images		_sources	genindex.html	intro.html	notebooks.html	search.html
_panels_static	_static		index.html	markdown.html	objects.inv	searchindex.js
```

the static folder contains the rest of the formatting
```
ls _static/

We didn't have to write any html and we got a responsive site!

If you wanted to change the styling with sphinx you can use built in
[themes](https://sphinx-themes.org/) which tell sphinx to put different
files in the `_static` folder when it builds your site, but you don't have to change any of your content!  If you like working on front end things (which is great! it's just not alwasy the goal) you can even
build [your own theme](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/development/theming.html) that can work with sphinx.

Jupyterbook is pretty opinionated on the styling, but for more general
documenation websites the options are good

```
cd ../../

```

```
ls
_build			intro.md		notebooks.ipynb
_config.yml		logo.png		references.bib
_toc.yml		markdown.md		requirements.txt

```

We're going to ignore the built files and use this later to automatically build them on GitHub.
```
echo "_build/" > .gitignore

```

```
git status
On branch main
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	.gitignore

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

```
and then add and commit
```
git add .

```

```
git commit -m 'ignroe build'
[main 3e249ce] ignroe build
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 .gitignore

```

## How do I push a repo that I made locally to GitHub

For today, create an [ empty github repo shared with me](https://classroom.github.com/a/KUYVBeb8).

More generally, you can [create a repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo)

That default page for an empty repo if you do not initiate it with any files will give you the instructions for what remote to add.

THen we add the remote

```
git remote add origin https://github.com/introcompsys/tiny-book-brownsarahm.git

```
and push to origin main.

```
git push -u origin main

## Questions after class  


### Could I use jupyterbook to put a resume online?
```{toggle}
In theory, yes. However there are other tools that work similar in the sense of separating content from HTML/CSS/javascript in order to generate a website. Sphinx is more customizable, as noted above, but also, [Static site generators](https://jamstack.org/generators/) are a whole category of software tools.  

GitHub [pages](https://pages.github.com/) is free hosting, which by default uses [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) however, that is no longer very active, due to the [death of one of the core maintainers](https://www.bridgetownrb.com/future/rip-jekyll/).

Some are centered on blog type sites (like jekyll) others are not. There are even ways to use a [javascript slide tool](https://revealjs.com/) to write in [markdown](https://revealjs.com/markdown/) but render for the web.
```
