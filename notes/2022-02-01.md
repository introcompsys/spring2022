# How do I use git offline

## Todays Goals
- just enough bash
- offline git basics
- practice with issues as something to *do* while we work with git offline



## Closing an Issue with a commit


We can close issues with commits, we'll first review making commits in browser
to see how that works, then we will do it offline again.  

Use the create a [test repo for today's class](https://classroom.github.com/a/iIl5Vvlp)
it will have some issues it in upon creation.

<a screen shot here would be good>


Notice what happened:
- the file is added and the commit has the the message
- the issue is closed
- if we go look at the closed issues, we can see on the issue that it was linked to the commit
- from the issue, we can see what the changes were that made are supposed to relate to this


```{note}
we can still comment on an issue that is already closed.
```

```{admonition} Try it Yourself
We can also re-open issues.
Try that out and then make a new commit to close it again. Why is this a useful
feature for GitHub?
```



## Getting Set up Locally

Opening different terminals
- default terminal on mac, ue the `bash` command to use bash (zsh will be mostly the same; it's derivative, but to ensure exactly the same as mine use bash)
- use gitbash on Windows

To change directory
```bash
cd path/to/go/to
```

To make a directory (folder) for things in this course (or in my case for inclass time)
```bash
mkdir sysinclass
```

Then we have to `cd` into that new folder:
```
cd sysinclass/
```




To view where we are, we **p**rint **w**orking **d**irectory

```bash
pwd
```


View files

```bash
ls
```

It's empty for now, but we will change that soon.

## Using Git and GitHub locally

### Authenticating with GitHub

There are many ways to authenticate securely with GitHub and other git clients.  We're going to use *easier* ones for today, but we'll come back to the third, which is a bit more secure and is a more general type of authentication.

1. GitHub CLI: enter the following and follow the prompts.

    ```
    gh auth login
    ```
1. [personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token). This is a special one time password that you can use like a password, but it is limited in scope and will expire (as long as you choose settings well)
1. ssh keys


### Cloning a repository


Cloning a repository makes a local copy of a remote git repository.

<!-- this is a markdown (html) comment, fill in the following and uncomment it (or part of it) as a contribution
```{admonition} Further Reading

[Git documentation basics chapter](url/here)

[git clone reference ]() from git documentation

[github docs cloning a repository]()

[github cli cloning]()
```
 -->


We can clone in two different ways, with git only or with the GitHub CLI tools.
````{margin}
```{warning}
My repository, like yours, is private so copying these lines directly will not work.  You will have to replace my GitHub username with your own.
```
````

with the GitHub CLI:
```
gh repo clone introcompsys/github-in-class-brownsarahm
```

with git only:
```
git clone https://github.com/introcompsys/github-in-class-brownsarahm.git
```

```{important}
the git only version can be used with git repositories that are hosted anywhere, for example on [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/)  
or [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/)
```

Either way we will see something like this:
```
Cloning into 'github-in-class-brownsarahm'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 15, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (15/15), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (9/9), done.
remote: Total 15 (delta 2), reused 5 (delta 1), pack-reused 0
Receiving objects: 100% (15/15), done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (2/2), done.
```
<!-- describing what this output means would be a great contribution -->

Now we can check what happened using `ls`
```
github-in-class-brownsarahm
```

When we clone a repository, it creates a new directory and downloads all of the contents and the repository information, including where it came from so that we can send our new changes back there.

### Adding new files to a Repository Locally

We first go into that folder.
```
cd github-in-class-brownsarahm/
```

We can see what is there.

```bash
ls
```

```
README.md
touch about.md
```


```bash
ls
```
and then we see the list of files
```
README.md	about.md
```

```bash
git status
```

which gives us the following output
```
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	about.md

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```
<!-- describing what happens here is a great contirbution also adding the images from prismia is too -->


```
ls -a
.		.git		README.md
..		.github		about.md
```


```
git add .
```

again, we can check what git knows about

```
git status
```

and take note of the key differences from before.
<!--  more interpretation here is a great contribution -->
```
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
	new file:   about.md

git commit -m 'create empty about'
[main b81cf15] create empty about
 1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
 create mode 100644 about.md
```

### Text editing on the terminal

```
nano about.md
```
then we can edit the file, adding some content and then write out (to save) and then exit nano


### Commiting Changes to a file
```
git status
On branch main
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 1 commit.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   about.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

```bash
git add about.md
```

```bash
git status
On branch main
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 1 commit.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
	modified:   about.md
```

```bash
git commit -m 'complete about closes #2
> '

[main 17320fc] complete about closes #2
 1 file changed, 4 insertions(+)
```

```
git status
On branch main
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 2 commits.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

### Sending Changes to GitHub

```
git push
Enumerating objects: 7, done.
Counting objects: 100% (7/7), done.
Delta compression using up to 8 threads
Compressing objects: 100% (4/4), done.
Writing objects: 100% (6/6), 535 bytes | 535.00 KiB/s, done.
Total 6 (delta 1), reused 1 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
remote: Resolving deltas: 100% (1/1), done.
To https://github.com/introcompsys/github-in-class-brownsarahm.git
   f707186..17320fc  main -> main
```

Notice on GitHub that the issue is now closed. and the commit is referenced and shows the changes.

## A third way to close an issue

See the `classmate` issue:

```
owner:
- [ ] give a class mate access to the repo
- [ ] assign this issue to them

classmate:
- [ ] add `classmate.md` with your name and expected graduation on  a bracn `classmate`
- [ ] open a PR that will close this issue
```

1. Do the `owner` list in your repo (the on that ends with your user name)
1. Do the classmate actions in *another person's repo*
1. In *your own* repo, on the PR made by your class mate, tag `@sp21instructors` in a comment and then merge the PR.


### Controlling Access

When you are a repository owner or organization level admin, you can change who has access to a repository on the settings tab.

Since the course repositories are in an organization, you get to choose the [role](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/repository-roles-for-an-organization#permissions-for-each-role) for each collaborator or team. The [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/repository-roles-for-an-organization#permissions-for-each-role) define the roles and permissions, so you can always refer t that to choose the right one.



```{note}
I seeded these notes by using the `Export text` option from the mac terminal app.  Other terminals have similar options and you can always get *only* the list of commands you have run with `history`
```

## Prepare for next class
````{margin}
```{important}
If you do the last two after Thursday that's okay but the rest are important
practice to reinforce what you just learned and to prepare for what we will do
in class on Thursday.

```{tip}
The "prepare for class" section is the minimum, the "more practice" is more like what will be reqiured for a B, but there's ramp up time at the beginning.

 "Prepare for class" will generally be due at the time of the next class because we will use that stuff in the next class session.
"More practice" you can come back to as fits in your schedule, (though I don't recommend too big of a lag).
```
```
````

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: ["remove-input"]
display(Markdown('../_prepare/2022-02-01.md'))
```



````{margin}
```{tip}
remember you can copy text from here directly into your file
```
````
Questions:
```markdown
## Reflection
1. Describe the staging area (what happens after git add) in your own words. Can you think of an analogy for it? Is there anything similar in a hobby you have?
2. what step is the hardest for you to remember?
3. Compare and contrast using git on the terminal and through your IDE. when would each be better/worse?
4. Describe the commit that closed the `classmate` issue, who does it attribute the fix to?
```



## More Practice


```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: ["remove-input"]
display(Markdown('../_practice/2022-02-01.md'))
```




## Questions After class


### Can we push the file before commit? And if so, what will happen?
```{dropdown}
We discuss this in the next class. Technically what we push is the changes to the git repo, not the "file" so since vefore committing there are no changes that
git knows, you *can* push, but nothing will happen.

```



### what is the difference between add and commit? They seem to do the same thing to me.
```{dropdown}
Add puts it in the staging area, it's like half way there.  Commit actually adds an entry to the history.
```


### Is there a point to doing multiple commits before a push.
```{dropdown}
It depends.  A commit is a point that you can go back to, push, sends what you have locally to a remote (GitHub in this case). If you are only using Git to create a backup of your code
```



### Can I just use GitHub Desktop if I have it already?
```{dropdown}
The next class is designed to answer this question.  The shortest form is that, outside of this class, you can use git however you want. Here, we're learning the terminal version and Thursday we'll talk about why.  
```
