## Review


How can you write the history of a repo to a file?

We'll do this inside our in-class repo.

```bash
cd github-in-class-brownsarahm/
```

Recall, the `git log` command
```bash
git log
```

displays it in a text editor:

We can use a redirect `>` to send that to a file instead of to where it normally goes.

```bash

## Review: Anatomy of git

Recall that the `HEAD` file contains a pointer to the place in the git database that matches the current status of the directory
```bash
cat .git/HEAD
```

in this case it points to the head ref called main
```
ref: refs/heads/main
```

This is what `git status` uses, we can see that using our first git "plumbing" command
```bash
git cat-file -p refs/heads/main
```
````{margin}
```{note}
note that it's sort of like the bash command cat, but it *only* works on git *objects* the HEAD file is a plain text file that we can view with `cat`
```
````

Before we look at the output of this, let's examine the command:  
- [git cat-file](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-cat-file): displays git content
- -p (pretty print) option figure out the type of content and display it appropriately


```bash

## Git Plumbing in a Fresh repo



Recall we used `git init test` to create a new repo on Tuesday, let's got back to that.
```
cd ../test/
```

We can use `git status` to confirm that it is completely blank
```
git status
On branch main

No commits yet

nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)
```

The directory is also empty
```
ls -a
```

Except for the `.git` database

```
.	..	.git
```

And recall the different files.
```
ls .git/
HEAD		description	info		refs
config		hooks		objects
```

```{admonition} Try it yourself
Try to remember what each of those files/directories does, make a table and try to write each one's role. After, check your answers using [Tuesday's notes](2022-02-15)
```

## Git Objects

we noted above that the `git cat-file` only works to git objects. Lets see what objects there are. Today we will see three types today:

- blob objects: the content of your files (data)
- tree objects: stores file names and groups files together (organization)
- Commit Objects: stores information about the sha values of the snapshots

First, lets examine the `objects` directory.  This time, instead of using `ls` we'll use the `bash` command `find`. This pattern matches and looks for files or directories and lists the results
```
find .git/objects/
```

We see that it finds, the `object` directory itself and two subdirectories.
```
.git/objects/
.git/objects//pack
.git/objects//info
```

Let's look at another option of this command, the `-type` option filters the results and only returns the ones of the desired type.  We'll look at only files using `f`
```
find .git/objects/ -type f
```

In this empty repository, there are no files.


### Hashing

Let's create an object.  We have mentioned breifely before that git stores data by hashing it, so the  plumbing command `git hash-object` does exactly that.

```
echo 'text content' | git hash-object -w --stdin
```

Let's examine this command:
- `git hash-object` by default hashes the return the unique key to that particular content
- the `-w` option then tells git to alsow write that object to the database
- the `--stdin` option tells `git hash-object` to get the content to be processed from stdin instead of a file
- the `|` is called a pipe (what we saw before  was a redirect) it pipes a *process* output into the next command
- echo would write to stdout, with the pipe it passes that to stdin for the `git hash-object` to use


````{margin}
```{note}
the key is *unique* in that there is a one to one mapping from any particular content to a single key. However, as we saw in class, if we all do the same content, we all get the key same key back
```
````

and we see it returns the unique key to us:

```  
c182a93374d6b18a87e1f1e8a9a18812639c58c8
```

We can then view the file that was added to the database with `git cat-file` again.  Recall the `-p` option, uses information about the file type to display it in an appropriate manner.

```
git cat-file -p c182a93374d6b18a87e1f1e8a9a18812639c58c8
text content
```

So far, we added "text content" to the git database, but nothing in the directory:

```
ls
```

shows us that its an empty directory.


Lets create a file and add that to our git database. We will create the file with echo and a redirect:

```
echo 'version 1' > test.txt
```

then we can hash it and write to the database from the file this time.
```
git hash-object -w test.txt
83baae61804e65cc73a7201a7252750c76066a30
```

we can list the directory so and note that more directories have been made:
```
ls .git/objects/
83	c1	info	pack
```

Even better, we can use the `find` command filtered by type that we saw earlier.

```
find .git/objects/ -type f
.git/objects//c1/82a93374d6b18a87e1f1e8a9a18812639c58c8
.git/objects//83/baae61804e65cc73a7201a7252750c76066a30
```

We see that this created an additional file for each of the two has objects that we have created.


Let's append more text to the file, recall  two `>>` redirects to append instead of overwrite.

```
echo 'version 2' >> test.txt
```

We can confirm this worked as we expected:
```
cat test.txt
version 1
version 2
```

And then has the file
```
git hash-object -w test.txt
```

and view the hashed content using the key that was returned.
```
git cat-file -p 0c1e7391ca4e59584f8b773ecdbbb9467eba1547
version 1
version 2
```

So far, we have been adding a new hash of the whole file each time. We will see later that git *can* be more efficient than this because this would begin to take a lot of space very quickly.

### Tree Objects

The next type of object to inspect is the tree, since the tree is a git object, we can use `git cat-file` again.


```
git cat-file -p main^{tree}
```

but this test repo that we are working with does not have a tree yet, so it

```
fatal: Not a valid object name main^{tree}
```

We can confirm this using git status
```
git status
```

```
On branch main

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	test.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```


````{margin}
```{important}

This syntax works in `bash` but has common problems in other shells:

- CMD on Windows: the `^` character is used for escaping, so you have to double it:`git cat-file -p main^^{tree}`.
- PowerShell: parameters using ``{}`` characters have to be quoted to parse correctly, so use: `git cat-file -p 'master^{tree}'`.
- ZSH: the ^ character is used for globbing, so enclose the whole expression in quotes: `git cat-file -p "master^{tree}"`.
```
````


In a more complete repo, we can view the tree:

```
git cat-file -p main^{tree}
```

```
040000 tree c91892d93170077fea81f1d8009c4ccc91af1c29	.github

040000 tree 45fcb1dd311e5e45af759cb3627dca5f47f58f04	tests
```

We see a blob for each file and a tree for each directory. The blob objects refer to the last hashed version of the file added to this branch (main)



```
cat HEAD
ref: refs/heads/main
```

## Creating a Commit manually
```{warning}
this is revised relative to in class
```

In class we tried to add directly to the commit tree:

```
echo 'first commit' | git commit-tree c182a9
```

but this failed:

```
fatal: c182a93374d6b18a87e1f1e8a9a18812639c58c8 is not a valid 'tree' object
```

because we had skipped a step. We need to create the tree first.

You use this command to artificially add the earlier version of the test.txt file to a new staging area.

```
git update-index --add --cacheinfo 100644 \
  83baae61804e65cc73a7201a7252750c76066a30 test.txt
```
the `\` allows us to continue typing on a second visual line in one long command. this command puts the hashed object 83baae with file named `test.txt`

- this the plumbing command `git update-index` updates (or in this case creates an index, the staging area of our repository)
- the `--add` option is because the file doesn’t yet exist in your staging area (you don’t even have a staging area set up yet)
- `--cacheinfo` because the file you’re adding isn’t in your directory but is in your database. Then, you specify the mode, SHA-1, and filename

n this case, you’re specifying a mode of 100644, which means it’s a normal file.




```
git status
On branch main

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	test.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

```

```

```
git status

```



## Why didn't git cat-file work on HEAD?

We tried:

```bash
git cat-file -p HEAD
```
and saw an error

```bash
fatal: Not a valid object name HEAD
```

To confirm what it was doing wrong, we checked another repository:

```bash
git init test2
hint: Using 'master' as the name for the initial branch. This default branch name
hint: is subject to change. To configure the initial branch name to use in all
hint: of your new repositories, which will suppress this warning, call:
hint:
hint: 	git config --global init.defaultBranch <name>
hint:
hint: Names commonly chosen instead of 'master' are 'main', 'trunk' and
hint: 'development'. The just-created branch can be renamed via this command:
hint:
hint: 	git branch -m <name>
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/brownsarahm/Documents/sysinclass/test2/.git/
```

```
git cat-file -p HEAD
```

```
fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git
```

```bash
cd test2
```

```bash
git cat-file -p HEAD
```

```bash
fatal: Not a valid object name HEAD
```

We confirmed that this does not work.  

This was because I made a mistake, the HEAD file does not need `git cat-file` it is a plain text file, not a git blob (type) object.


### Could the lack of pushing be why?
```
cat .git/config
```

lets compare the results of this across two repos first for the small test repo:

```
[core]
	repositoryformatversion = 0
	filemode = true
	bare = false
	logallrefupdates = true
	ignorecase = true
	precomposeunicode = true
```
and for github-inclass:

```
[core]
	repositoryformatversion = 0
	filemode = true
	bare = false
	logallrefupdates = true
	ignorecase = true
	precomposeunicode = true
[remote "origin"]
	url = https://github.com/introcompsys/github-in-class-brownsarahm.git
	fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
[branch "main"]
	remote = origin
	merge = refs/heads/main
[branch "reset"]
	remote = origin
	merge = refs/heads/reset
```
This is all of the difference that is caused by the lack or configuring a remote.

We can view the heads by listing that directory
```
ls .git/refs/heads
```

```
main	reset	test
```

```{admonition} Further Reading
The goal of this exercise is to take an ethnographic approach to understanding the IDE(s) you use most often.
We will combine this with a more formal study of them soon. Approaching a topic through multiple lenses can help you understand it better and presenting you, as a group, with multiple ways is a strategy of mine to help make sure that every one of you finds *at least* one way that works for you.

# IDE Thoughts

## Actions Accomplished
<!-- list what things you do: run code/ edit code/ create new files/ etc; no need to comment on what the code you write does -->


## Features Used
<!-- list features of it that you use, like a file explorer, debugger, etc -->


```


## Questions After Class

### when does the grade-free zone end?
```{toggle}
It has ended, starting with the feedback given today, there will be grading implications, but remember there are flexibility systems with most of it.
```

### Are there other uses for the hashes besides identifying git files in our repositories
```{toggle}
for these particular hashes, no, they are the keys that mathc to values of items in our git database, but we can do other things with other hashes.
```


### what does print pretty / -p mean?
```{toggle}
this option of the git cat-file command displays the contents of a blob in a human readable format.
```

### will we ever need to use the plumbing tools in a bind?
```{toggle}
Some of them, yes! For example, today, it was helpful to use the plumbing command `git update-ref` to create a branch from a particular past commit. They could also help you to view a commit in greater detail and some other beyond what we saw today could help you edit a commit or alter the "history" of your repo if you need to.

The porcelain commands will get you through your day to day everything is going right and the most common mistakes.
```


### Questions addressed above integrated into the narrative

• I am still confused about the idea of the objects and what they do exactly/their purpose

• so all of the plumbing commands we used today are all the parts that are wrapped up in the processes like adding/committing/pushing things to GitHub?

### Questions to practice with

- What if we would change the file again (added 3rd line) and committed again. How many hash objects would be created? What connection would there be between the commits?


### Questions we will come back to next

- how are hash number formed?
- From init, first commit, to first push, what is the exact sequence of events that happens under the hood of git?
