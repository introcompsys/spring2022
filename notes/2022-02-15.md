# What actually *is* git?

## Grading Contract Q & A

[Grading contract information is added to the syllabus](../syllabus/grading)

and the [FAQ](../faq/syllabus) section


## Git is a File System with a Version Control user interface

[git is fundamentally a content-addressable filesystem with a VCS user interface written on top of it.](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Plumbing-and-Porcelain)



Porcelain: the user friendly VCS

Plumbing: the internal workings- a toolkit for a VCS


We have so far used git as a version control system.  A version control system, in general, will have operations like commit, push, pull, clone.  These may work differently under the hood or be called different things, but those are what something needs to have in order to



## Git is distributed


Git can have different workflows

![subversion workflow](https://git-scm.com/images/about/workflow-a@2x.png)



![integration manager workflow](https://git-scm.com/images/about/workflow-b@2x.png)



![dictator and lieutenants workflow](https://git-scm.com/images/about/workflow-c@2x.png)


## What are the parts of git?
and we're going to start by examinging our familiar github inclass repo



```
cd path/to/sysinclass/github-in-class-brownsarahm/
ls -a
```

```
.		.github		README.md	b_file		setup.py
..		CONTRIBUTING.md	a_file		docs		test_file.md
.git		LICENSE.md	about.md	mymodule	tests
```

We are going to look inside the git folder
```
cd .git
ls
```



```
COMMIT_EDITMSG	description	info		packed-refs
HEAD		hooks		logs		refs
config		index		objects
```

The most important parts:

|name | type| purpose|
|-----|----|-----|
|objects | directory | the content for your database  |
| refs | directory | pointers into commit objects in that data (branches, tags, remotes and more)|
| HEAD | file | points to the branch you currently have checked out|
| index| file | stores your staging area information. |

### Git HEAD

We can look at the head file
```
cat HEAD
```

we see

```
ref: refs/heads/main
```

This tells us where in the git history the current status of the repository is.  
This is what git uses when we call `git status`. It does more after reading that
file, but that is the first thing it does.


```
cd ..
git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	a_file
	b_file
	test_file.md

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

Note that the current branch is main and the HEAD file has a path to a file named
main in the `refs` directory.  

### Git Refs
We can loook at that

```
cat .git/refs/heads/main
```

we see the most recent commit hash.
```
cea6a93d576ecd042823fca24553a58a6cd6565b
```

We can verify this with `git log`

when we run this it opens the log interactively, so we see something like:
```
commit cea6a93d576ecd042823fca24553a58a6cd6565b (HEAD -> main, origin/main, origin/HEAD)
Author: Sarah Brown <brownsarahm@uri.edu>
Date:   Thu Feb 3 16:42:12 2022 -0500

    try to prevernt repeated running

```

In parenthesis that is what branches are pointed to that commit. Use enter/return
to scroll and press `q` to exit.  

```{admonition} Try it Yourself
use git log to draw a map that shows where the different branches are relative
to one another

```


```
cd ..
cd refs/
```

```
ls
heads	remotes	tags
```

```
cd heads/
ls
main	reset	test
```
this has one directory for each branch. we can confirm this with `git branch` at the top level.

```
cd ..
ls remotes/
```

```
origin
```

```

cd remotes/origin/
ls
```

```
HEAD	main	reset
```


```
(base) brownsarahm@origin $ cat HEAD
ref: refs/remotes/origin/main
(base) brownsarahm@origin $ cd main
-bash: cd: main: Not a directory
(base) brownsarahm@origin $ cat main
c15cf43b6807e172aaba7cf3b57adc7214b91082
(base) brownsarahm@origin $ cd ..

```

### Git Config  and branch naming

```
cd .git
cat config
```

and we see
```
[core]
	repositoryformatversion = 0
	filemode = true
	bare = false
	logallrefupdates = true
	ignorecase = true
	precomposeunicode = true
[remote "origin"]
	url = https://github.com/introcompsys/github-in-class-brownsarahm.git
	fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
[branch "main"]
	remote = origin
	merge = refs/heads/main
[branch "reset"]
	remote = origin
	merge = refs/heads/reset
```

This file tracks the different relationships between your local copy and remots that it knows.  This repository only knows one remote, named origin, with a url on GitHub.  A git repo can have multiple remotes, each with its own name and url.

it also maps each local branch to its corresponding origin and the local place you would merge to when you pull from that remote branch.



```{warning}
I remoeved looking at the index here, we're going to come back to it with more time to inspect it more carefully on Thursday

```
### Git Objects
```
cd objects/
ls
```

```
0c	35	55	87	b6	c1	pack
17	45	79	b5	b8	info
```




##  Starting a Git Repository from Scratch

We'll create  clear repo at the top levle of our inclass directory so that it is not inside another repo
```
cd ..
pwd
```

```
/path/to/Documents/sysinclass
```

then ceate the repo with
```
git init test
```

````{margin}
```{note}
[official statement on git branch naming](https://sfconservancy.org/news/2020/jun/23/gitbranchname/)
```

[GitHub](https://www.zdnet.com/article/github-to-replace-master-with-main-starting-next-month/) moved a little faster and used a [repo](https://github.com/github/renaming) to share info about their process

[this change was complex and spurred a lot of discussion](https://www.wired.com/story/tech-confronts-use-labels-master-slave/)
````

```
hint: Using 'master' as the name for the initial branch. This default branch name
hint: is subject to change. To configure the initial branch name to use in all
hint: of your new repositories, which will suppress this warning, call:
hint:
hint: 	git config --global init.defaultBranch <name>
hint:
hint: Names commonly chosen instead of 'master' are 'main', 'trunk' and
hint: 'development'. The just-created branch can be renamed via this command:
hint:
hint: 	git branch -m <name>
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/brownsarahm/Documents/sysinclass/test/.git/
```


```
git branch -m main
fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git
```

```
cd test
git branch -m main
```


and we can confirm it works with
```
git status
```
to see that it is now on branch main.
```
On branch main

No commits yet

nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)

## Questions after class


### when should the grading contract be turned in?
```{toggle}
First draft is due Thursday, Feb 17 at 4pm as in the README
```

### Can you create multiple remotes that have the same name?
```{toggle}
no each remote has to have a different name, like each variable in a program has to be unique if you try to create a new remote with the same name it would overwrite the old one
```


### what does it mean when a branch is both x commits ahead of main, but also y commits behind?
```{toggle}
that means that there have been y commits to main that are not included on the other branch **and** that there are x commits to the other branch that are not on main.
```


### Should we be working with Git entirely from the terminal for classwork or is it our preference?
```{toggle}
In class, we will use the terminal because it is the most consistent and transparent.  For other work, you can edit it however you like.  You can work in browser, with the GitHub desktop client, using the GitHub CLI, or your favorite IDE's tools. I recommend giving the terminal a serious try because it will have all of the features of git and other tools may not, but your preference is fine.  It could actually be really good for your general understanding to practice with git at least two ways.
```

### Will we be using the github cli to publish our repo to github?
```{toggle}
We are going to mostly use the base git CLI because it is more general and usable in more contexts (for example, your remote could be on GitLab or BitBucket or an internal private server)
```

### Questions we will answer in the next couple of classes

1. What is the purpose of the index file?
1. How do you add your local repo to github?
1. What would happen if we would change this hexadecimal code which is in the files in .git?
1. Are any more efficient ways to navigate through repositories and git files
