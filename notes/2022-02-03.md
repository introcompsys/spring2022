# Why Do I Need to Use a terminal?

We will go back to the same repository we worked with on Tuesday, for me that was
```
cd Documents/teaching/sysinclass/github-in-class-brownsarahm/
```

We can use `touch` that we saw Tuesday to create many files at once:
```
touch abstract_base_class.py helper_functions.py important_classes.py alternative_classes.py README.md LICENSE.md CONTRIBUTING.md setup.py tests_abc.py test_help.py test_imp.py test_alt.py overview.md API.md _config.yml
_toc.yml philosophy.md example.md Untitled.ipynb Untitled01.ipynb Untitled02.ipynb
```

we got an error from this:

```
-bash: _toc.yml: command not found
```
we can intermet this, bash thought `_toc.yml` was a command.  That means there
was a hard to see accidental line break in the text above.  


If we didn't know what that meant, we could also investigate further using `ls`
to list.

```
ls
```

we see we have most of the files actually created,
```
API.md			abstract_base_class.py	test_alt.py
CONTRIBUTING.md		alternative_classes.py	test_help.py
LICENSE.md		helper_functions.py	test_imp.py
README.md		important_classes.py	tests_abc.py
_config.yml		overview.md
about.md		setup.py
```

we can use the up arrow key to get back the last line.
```
_toc.yml philosophy.md example.md Untitled.ipynb Untitled01.ipynb Untitled02.ipynb
```

and add `touch` at the start of it to create those last few files.
```
touch _toc.yml philosophy.md example.md Untitled.ipynb Untitled01.ipynb Untitled02.ipynb
```

and confirm
```
ls
```

## Scenario

```{note}
a few of you asked about learning how to organize projects.  While our main focus
in this class session is the `bash` commands to do it, the *task* that we are
going to do is to organize a hypothetical python project
```

Now we have all of these files,  named in abstract ways to
signal hypothecial contents and suggest how to organize them.
```
API.md			_toc.yml		philosophy.md
CONTRIBUTING.md		about.md		setup.py
LICENSE.md		abstract_base_class.py	test_alt.py
README.md		alternative_classes.py	test_help.py
Untitled.ipynb		example.md		test_imp.py
Untitled01.ipynb	helper_functions.py	tests_abc.py
Untitled02.ipynb	important_classes.py
_config.yml		overview.md
```

First we're goign to paste some contents (shared from prismia, view below) in
to the readme with [nano](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Nano#Using_Nano)

```
nano README.md
```

We can view the contents of the file using `cat` to print the contents to the
terminal output.
```
cat README.md
```
and we see:
```
# GitHub Practice

Name: sarah
|file | contents |
| ------| ------- |
| abstract_base_class.py | core abstract classes for the project |
| helper_functions.py | utitly funtions that are called by many classes |
| important_classes.py | classes that inherit from the abc |
| alternative_classes.py | classes that inherit from the abc |
| LICENSE.md | the info on how the code can be reused|
| CONTRIBUTING.md | instructions for how people can contribute to the project|
| setup.py | file with function with instructions for pip |
| tests_abc.py | tests for constructors and methods in abstract_base_class.py|
| tests_helpers.py | tests for constructors and methods in helper_functions.py|
| tests_imp.py | tests for constructors and methods in important_classes.py|
| tests_alt.py | tests for constructors and methods in alternative_classes.py|
| API.md | jupyterbook file to generate api documentation |
| _config.yml | jupyterbook config for documentation |
| _toc.yml | jupyter book toc file for documentation |
| philosophy.md | overview of how the code is organized for docs |
| example.md | myst notebook example of using the code |
| Untitled*.ipynb | jupyter notebook from dev, not important to keep |
```

this explains each file a little bit more than the name of it does.
We see there are sort of 5 groups of files:
- about the project/repository
- code that defines a python module
- test code
- documentation
- extra files that "we know" we can delete.


## Making Directories

First we will make directories. We saw `mkdir` on Tuesday

```
mkdir docs/
```

This doesn't return anything, but we can see the effect with `ls`
```
ls
```

```
API.md			_toc.yml		overview.md
CONTRIBUTING.md		about.md		philosophy.md
LICENSE.md		abstract_base_class.py	setup.py
README.md		alternative_classes.py	test_alt.py
Untitled.ipynb		docs			test_help.py
Untitled01.ipynb	example.md		test_imp.py
Untitled02.ipynb	helper_functions.py	tests_abc.py
_config.yml		important_classes.py
```

We might not want to make them all one at a time. Like with `touch` we can
pass multiple names to mkdir with spaces between to make multiple at once.

```
mkdir tests mymodule
```

and again use `ls` to see the output
```
API.md			about.md		philosophy.md
CONTRIBUTING.md		abstract_base_class.py	setup.py
LICENSE.md		alternative_classes.py	test_alt.py
README.md		docs			test_help.py
Untitled.ipynb		example.md		test_imp.py
Untitled01.ipynb	helper_functions.py	tests
Untitled02.ipynb	important_classes.py	tests_abc.py
_config.yml		mymodule
_toc.yml		overview.md
```

## Moving files

we can move files with `mv`. We'll first move the philosophy.md file into docs
and check that it worked.
```
mv philosophy.md docs/
ls
```

```
API.md			_toc.yml		mymodule
CONTRIBUTING.md		about.md		overview.md
LICENSE.md		abstract_base_class.py	setup.py
README.md		alternative_classes.py	test_alt.py
Untitled.ipynb		docs			test_help.py
Untitled01.ipynb	example.md		test_imp.py
Untitled02.ipynb	helper_functions.py	tests
_config.yml		important_classes.py	tests_abc.py
```


### Getting help in bash
To learn more about the mv command, we can use the man(ual) file.

```
man mv
```

use enter/return or arrows to scroll and `q` to quit

If we type something wrong, the error message also provides some help
```
mv ls
usage: mv [-f | -i | -n] [-v] source target
       mv [-f | -i | -n] [-v] source ... directory
```

We can use man on any bash command to see the options so we do not need to
remember them all, or go to the internet every time we need help.  We have high
quality help for the details right in the shell, if we remember the basics.

```
man ls
```

```
ls -hl
```

```

```


In some versions of bash we can use:
```
mv --help

```



### Moving multiple files with patterns


let's look at the list of files again.
```
cat README.md
```

```
# GitHub Practice

Name: sarah
|file | contents |
| ------| ------- |
| abstract_base_class.py | core abstract classes for the project |
| helper_functions.py | utitly funtions that are called by many classes |
| important_classes.py | classes that inherit from the abc |
| alternative_classes.py | classes that inherit from the abc |
| LICENSE.md | the info on how the code can be reused|
| CONTRIBUTING.md | instructions for how people can contribute to the project|
| setup.py | file with function with instructions for pip |
| test_abc.py | tests for constructors and methods in abstract_base_class.py|
| test_helpers.py | tests for constructors and methods in helper_functions.py|
| test_imp.py | tests for constructors and methods in important_classes.py|
| tests_alt.py | tests for constructors and methods in alternative_classes.py|
| API.md | jupyterbook file to generate api documentation |
| _config.yml | jupyterbook config for documentation |
| _toc.yml | jupyter book toc file for documentation |
| philosophy.md | overview of how the code is organized for docs |
| example.md | myst notebook example of using the code |
| scratch.ipynb | jupyter notebook from dev |
```

````{margin}
```{note}
this is why good file naming is important even if you have not organized the
whole project yet, you can use the good conventions to help yourself later.
```
````

 We see that the ones with similar purposes have similar names.

We can use `*` as a wildcard operator and then move will match files to that
pattern and move them all. We'll start with the two `yml` [(yaml)](https://yaml.org/)
files that are both for the documentation.

```
mv *.yml docs/
```



### Renaming a single file with mv

We see that most of the test files start with `test_` but one starts with
`tests_`. We could use the pattern `test*.py` to move them all without
conflicting with the directory `tests/` but we also want consistent names.

We can use `mv` to change the name as well. This is because "moving" a file and
is really about changing its path, not actually copying it from one location to
another and the file name is a part of the path.
```
mv tests_abc.py test_abc.py
ls
```
now that it's fixed
```
API.md			abstract_base_class.py	setup.py
CONTRIBUTING.md		alternative_classes.py	test_abc.py
LICENSE.md		docs			test_alt.py
README.md		example.md		test_help.py
Untitled.ipynb		helper_functions.py	test_imp.py
Untitled01.ipynb	important_classes.py	tests
Untitled02.ipynb	mymodule
about.md		overview.md
```

We can use the pattern `test_*` to move them all.
```
mv test_* tests/
ls
```

```
API.md			Untitled02.ipynb	helper_functions.py
CONTRIBUTING.md		about.md		important_classes.py
LICENSE.md		abstract_base_class.py	mymodule
README.md		alternative_classes.py	overview.md
Untitled.ipynb		docs			setup.py
Untitled01.ipynb	example.md		tests
```

Now we can move all of the other .py files to the module
```
mv *.py mymodule/
ls
```

```
API.md			Untitled01.ipynb	mymodule
CONTRIBUTING.md		Untitled02.ipynb	overview.md
LICENSE.md		about.md		tests
README.md		docs
Untitled.ipynb		example.md
```

## Working with relative paths

Let's review our info again
```
cat README.md
# GitHub Practice

Name: sarah
|file | contents |
| ------| ------- |
| abstract_base_class.py | core abstract classes for the project |
| helper_functions.py | utitly funtions that are called by many classes |
| important_classes.py | classes that inherit from the abc |
| alternative_classes.py | classes that inherit from the abc |
| LICENSE.md | the info on how the code can be reused|
| CONTRIBUTING.md | instructions for how people can contribute to the project|
| setup.py | file with function with instructions for pip |
| tests_abc.py | tests for constructors and methods in abstract_base_class.py|
| tests_helpers.py | tests for constructors and methods in helper_functions.py|
| tests_imp.py | tests for constructors and methods in important_classes.py|
| tests_alt.py | tests for constructors and methods in alternative_classes.py|
| API.md | jupyterbook file to generate api documentation |
| _config.yml | jupyterbook config for documentation |
| _toc.yml | jupyter book toc file for documentation |
| philosophy.md | overview of how the code is organized for docs |
| example.md | myst notebook example of using the code |
| scratch.ipynb | jupyter notebook from dev |
```

We've made a mistake, `setup.py` is actually instructions that need to be at the
top level, not inside the module's sub directory.

We can get it back using the relative path to the file and then using `.` to
move it to where we "are" sicne we are in the top level directory still.

```
mv mymodule/setup.py .
ls
```

```
API.md			Untitled01.ipynb	mymodule
CONTRIBUTING.md		Untitled02.ipynb	overview.md
LICENSE.md		about.md		setup.py
README.md		docs			tests
Untitled.ipynb		example.md
```

Or, if we put it back temporarily
```
mv setup.py mymodule/
```

We can cd to where we put it
```
cd mymodule/
ls
```

```
abstract_base_class.py	helper_functions.py	setup.py
alternative_classes.py	important_classes.py
```

and move it up a level using `..`
```
mv setup.py ..
ls
```

```
abstract_base_class.py	helper_functions.py
alternative_classes.py	important_classes.py
```

then the `..` to go up a level gets us back to where we were.
```
cd ..
ls
```

```
API.md			Untitled01.ipynb	mymodule
CONTRIBUTING.md		Untitled02.ipynb	overview.md
LICENSE.md		about.md		setup.py
README.md		docs			tests
Untitled.ipynb		example.md
```

Now we'll move the last few docs files.
```
mv API.md docs/
mv example.md docs/
mv overview.md docs/
ls
```

## Removing files

We still have to deal with the untitled files that we know we don't need any more.

```
CONTRIBUTING.md		Untitled01.ipynb	mymodule
LICENSE.md		Untitled02.ipynb	setup.py
README.md		about.md		tests
Untitled.ipynb		docs
```



````{sidebar}

If we type
```
rm U
```
then it canot tab complete the whole file name we get only

```
rm Untitled
```

because there are multiple.  If we
prest tab twice in a row, it will return the list of possible options  
```
Untitled.ipynb    Untitled01.ipynb  Untitled02.ipynb  
```
and re-seed the input with
```
rm Untitled
```
so we can type whatever else we want to add to pick the one we want.

````

we can delete them with `rm` and use `*` to delet them all.
```
rm Untitled*
```



```
ls
```
now we have a nice clean repository.


```
CONTRIBUTING.md	README.md	docs		setup.py
LICENSE.md	about.md	mymodule	tests
```


## Copying

The typical contents of the README we would also want in the documentation
website.  We might add to the file later, but that's a good start.  We can do
that by copying.

When we copy we designate the file to copy and a path/name for the copy we want
to make.

```
cp README.md docs/index.md
cd docs/
ls
```

```

API.md		_toc.yml	index.md	philosophy.md
_config.yml	example.md	overview.md
```
we can check the contents of the file too:
```
cat index.md
```


```

```
it matches .


## More relative paths

We need a `__init__.py` in the mymodule directory but we are in the docs
directory currently.
No problem!
```
touch ../mymodule/__init__.py
```



```
git status
```

```
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   ../README.md

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	../CONTRIBUTING.md
	../LICENSE.md
	./
	../mymodule/
	../setup.py
	../tests/

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

note we have both changes and untracked files.. but wherre is the docs folder?

we're in there so all of the files are listed relative to there, so it's the `./`
line to say that we are currently in an untracked directory. Git status doesn't look
inside directories it doens't know if it should track or not.

if we go back to the top level
```
cd ..
```

```
git status
```

````{margin}
```{tip}
Compare these two outputs carefully. Getting used to noticing these details will
help you get yourself unstuck!
```
````

```
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   README.md

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	CONTRIBUTING.md
	LICENSE.md
	docs/
	mymodule/
	setup.py
	tests/

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

Then we can add the changes and push
```
git add .
git commit -m 'insclass 2-3'
```

above since we didn't make a branch we pushed to main.
```
git status
```

```
On branch main

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

We could make the file changes first and then make the branch we want to commit
them too as well.  it's best to make the branch first so you don't forget, but
it is an option
```
touch test_file.md
```
```
git status
```

```
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

```
git checkout -b test
```

```
git status
```
```
On branch test
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

## Recap

Why do I need a terminal
1. replication/automation
1. it's always there and doesn't change  
1. it's faster one you know it (also see above)

```{epigraph}
So, is the shell the feature that interacts with the operating system and then the terminal is the gui that interacts with the shell?
```

This week we saw two really important tools. Next week we're going to take a
sort of archealogical look at computer systems, first software then hardware to
wrap up our overivew and exploration of what all these topics we're going to
cover in class are and how they relate.

(class5prep)=
## Prepare for the next class


```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: ["remove-input"]
display(Markdown('../_prepare/2022-02-03.md'))
```

### Terminal File moving reflection

Start with a file explorer open, but then try to close it and use only command line tools to explore and make your choices

```markdown
1. Did this get easier toward the end?
1. Use the history to see which commands you used and how many times each, make a table below.
1. Did you have to look up how to do anything we had not done in class?
1. When do you think that using the terminal will be better than using your GUI file explorer?
1. What questions/challenges/ relfections do you have after this?
1. What kinds of things might you want to write a bash script for given what you know in bash so far? come up with 1-2 scenarios
```

### Software Reflection


```markdown
1. link to public repo if applicable or title of your project
1. What types of files are there that are not code?
1. What different types of code files are in the project? Do they serve different goals?
1. Is it all in one language or are there multiple?
1. Try to figure out (remember) how the project works. What types of things, without running the code can you look at at a high level?
```



## More Practice

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: ["remove-input"]
display(Markdown('../_practice/2022-02-03.md'))
```



## Questions at the end of class


### what makes a file be able to stage? In other words, what does "staging" actually mean?


```{dropdown}
We stage **changes** on a file by file basis, not the files themselves.  Remember,
git's goal is *version control* to it wants to keep track of the different versions
of your project. It does this by looking at what has changed. The .git record
is like a playback of what you *did* to the files in the repository, not copies
of them at each time.  We'll come back to this in more detail soon, too.  
```

### how do you make a branch on the GitHub site?
```{dropdown}
You can create a new branch in browser on GitHub by committing a change.  You
can switch to other branches from the main code tab of your repository, and
then add more changes there if you want to, for example make changes to multiple
files in a single pull request without downloading the code.  
```

###  how do we write a bash script?

```{dropdown}
We will do this soon. The short answer is that it is just like programming in
any other language.
```

### Where can I learn more about the GitHub flow?

```{dropdown}
The [GitHub Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)
is a way to work on a git repository using branches.  It has become pretty
standard. The GitHub docs give a good overview of it.

### How do we link a project we already have made to a new git repository

```{dropdown}
So far, I have only had you create repositories through some GitHub helpers
provided by GitHub classroom.  You can create a new repository from scratch
using the plus sign menu on the top right of any page on GitHub.  GitHub will
give you the instructions to either start blank so that you can add files you
already have locally or with a README and other starter files for a brand new
project.
```
### what can happen if I moved a file but I had another file pointing to the old address

```{dropdown}
`mv` can be used to rename, so by the same thing it will overwrite and it will
do so without warning you.  Manipulating files reqiures care.
```

### how in depth will our bash scripting go in this class? clearly it can be used for a lot of different things

```{dropdown}
We will do some common most helpful things in class time. You can explore it
more in depth outside of class time as a part of the "extended labs" or project
you do for a B or an A.
```
### How might you go about re-instantiating a repo? I.e. starting back from whatever the origin is
```{dropdown}
We used checkout for switching branches so far, but it can also be used to
switch back to a different commit.
