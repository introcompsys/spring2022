1. Review the questions from today's class and write a solution guide for any that you got wrong with notes about what confused you in `review.md`  (to make sure you do not leave with misconceptions)
1. Add `conclusion.md` to your KWL repo.  In the file include 2 sections: **summary** with an overall description of what you learned and how this course was/not helpful to you (paragraph or bullet form is fine) **key points** with the top 10 things you want to make sure you remember from this class (to reinforce these concepts *and* serve as a quick reference for yourself in the future)
