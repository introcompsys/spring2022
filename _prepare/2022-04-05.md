1. Add `bitwise.md` to your kwl and write the bitwise operations required for the following transformations:
    ```
    4 -> 128
    12493 - > -12494
    127 -> 15
    7 -> 56
    4 -> -5
    ```
1. For the following figure out the bitwise operator:
    ```
    45 (_) 37 = 37
    45 (_) 37 = 45
    3 (_) 5 = 7
    6 (_) 8 = 0
    10 (_) 5 = 15
    ```
1. Create `readingbytes.md` and answer the following:
    ```
    1. if a file had the following binary contents, what would it display in the terminal? Describe how you can figure this out manually and check it using C or Python. '01110011011110010111001101110100011001010110110101110011'
    1. What is the contents of the `sample.bn` if `cat sample.bn` is: ` ¢¶"*`
    ```
1. Read about integer overflow and in `overflow.md` describe what it is, use an example assuming an 8 bit system.
