1. Check that jupyter book is installed on your computer [and the windows advice](https://jupyterbook.org/advanced/windows.html#working-on-windows)
1. Fix any open PRs you have that need to be rebased.
1. In your github in class repo, create a series of commits that tell as story of how you might have made a mistake and fixed it. Use git log and redirects to write that log to a file, `gitstory.md` in your KWL repo and then annotate your story to add in any narrative that didn't fit in the commit messages. This could be that you made a mistake in your code and used git to recover or that you got your git database to an undesirable state and got it back on track.
