# Syllabus and Grading FAQ



## How much does activity x weigh in my grade?
```{toggle}
There is no specific weight for any activities, because your grade is based on fulfilling your contract. If all items are completed to a satisfactory level, then you earn that grade, if not, then you will be prompted to revise the contract to signal that you are aware you have complted fewer items.
```


## Can I submit this assignment late if ...?
```{toggle}
In this class, there are feedback hours instead of deadlines for specific assignments.  If your work is not in by the feedback hours, you will get feedback at the next hours. If your grading contract has dated milestones, (eg for a project) post an issue in your contract repo with title `late milestone: <name of milestone>` and in the body proposes when it will be in instead and how this delay will not affect your future work.  If you need more dramatic shift, propose a revision to your contract.
```

## I don't understand the feedback  on this assignment
```{toggle}
If you have questions about your grade, the best place to get feedback is to reply on the Feedback PR.  Either reply directly to one of the inline comments, or the summary.

Be specific about what you think is wrong so that we can expand more.

## What should a Deeper exploration look like and where do I put it?
```{toggle}
It should be a tutorial or blog style piece of writing, likely with code
excerpts or screenshots embedded in it.

[an example that uses mostly screenshots](https://rhodyprog4ds.github.io/BrownFall21/notes/2021-09-10.html)

[an example of heavily annotated code](https://rhodyprog4ds.github.io/BrownFall21/notes/2021-09-17.html)

They should be markdown files in your KWL repo.  I recommend myst markdown.
```
