In a new terminal window, navigate there and then move the your KWL chart to a file called `chart.md`. Create a new README files with a list of all the files in your repo. Use `history N` (N is the number of past commands that history will return) and redirects to write the steps you took to `reorg.md`.

    - `echo "hello world" > fa > fb`
    - `echo "a test" > fc fd`
    - `> fe echo "hi there"`
    - `echo "hello " > ff world`
    - `<ff echo hello`
    - `fa < echo hello there`
    - `cat`
