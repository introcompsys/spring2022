1. **priority** write a script that outputs the first 3 lines of each `.fastq` line and sbatch script that runs it and saves the output to files and e-mails you when it is done. Submit the job. (to reinforce /practice what we saw in class)
1. File permissions are represented numerically often in octal, by transforming the permissions for each level (owner, group, all) as binary into a number. Add `octal.md` to your KWL repo and answer the following. Try to think through it on your own, but you may look up the answers, as long as you link to (or ideally cite using jupyterbook citations) a high quality source.

    ```
    1. Transform the permissions [`r--`, `rw-`, `rwx`] to octal, by treating it as three bits.
    1. Transform the permission we changed our script to `rwxr-xr-x` to octal.
    1. Which of the following would prevent a file from being edited by other people 777 or 755? 
    ```
1. Answer the following in `hpc.md` of your KWL repo:  (to think about how the design of the system we used in class impacts programming and connect it to other ideas taught in CS)

    ```
    1. What kinds of things would your code need to do if you were going to run it on an HPC system?
    1. What Sbatch options seem the most helpful?
    1. How might you go about setting the time limits for a script? How could you estimate how long it will take?
    ```
